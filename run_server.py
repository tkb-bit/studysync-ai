# This manually creates and runs the ChromaDB server application.
# It is a more robust way to start the server than the command line.

# NOTE: Before running for the first time, you may need to install uvicorn:
# pip install uvicorn

app = App()

# If you get an error here, try running 'pip install uvicorn' in your terminal
uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
